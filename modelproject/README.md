# Model analysis project

The project is titled **IS-LM model** and is about analyzing the demand side of an economy by looking at the relationship between the interest rate and the GDP.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Final_modelproject.ipynb](Final_modelproject.ipynb).

**Note:** Make sure to restart kernel if you want to run a cell again, otherwise the results might change or an error could show up.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
